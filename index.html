                    <p>Sicily -  is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is an autonomous region of Italy, 
                    in Southern Italy along with surrounding minor islands, officially referred to as Regione Siciliana.    
                    The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By around 750 BC, Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and, for the next 600 years, 
                    it was the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 
                    5th century AD, Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, 
                    the Byzantine Empire, and the Emirate of Sicily. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Norman conquest of southern Italy led 
                    to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily, which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen, 
                    the Capetian House of Anjou, Spain, the House of Habsburg,[7] It was finally unified under
                    the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand, a revolt led
                    by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification, and a plebiscite. Sicily was given 
                    special status as an autonomous region after the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946.

                    <p>Slovakia officially the Slovak Republic is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is bordered 
                    by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east and Hungary to the south.

                    Slovakia's territory spans about 49,000 square kilometres (19,000 sq mi) and is mostly mountainous.
                    The population is over 5 million and comprises mostly ethnic Slovaks. The capital and largest city is Bratislava. 
                    The official language is Slovak.

                    The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries. In the 7th century,
                    they played a significant role in the creation of Samo's Empire and in the 9th century established the Principality of Nitra. 
                    In the 10th century, the territory was integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary.

                    After World War I and the dissolution 
                    of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Slovaks and Czechs established Czechoslovakia. A separate (First) Slovak Republic (1939–1945) 
                    existed in World War II as a client state of Nazi Germany. In 1945, Czechoslovakia was re-established and under Communist rule became 
                    Soviet satellite. In 1989, the Velvet Revolution ended Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. Slovakia became an independent state
                    on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia, sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce.
